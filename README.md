# cs-quicksort-algorithm

While reading "A Common Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms" by Jay Wengrow, I decided to practice implementing the QuickSort algorithm in C#.

To use the program, clone down the repo. Then, run ```dotnet run``` in command line after cd'ing into the QuickSortPractice/ sub-directory, and enter a list of numbers to be sorted.
