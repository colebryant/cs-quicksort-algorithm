# quicksort-algorithm

While reading "A Common Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms" by Jay Wengrow, I decided to practice implementing the QuickSort algorithm in C#.

To use the program, clone down the repo by running ```git clone git@github.com:colebryant/cs-quicksort-algorithm.git``` in the console in your directory of choice. Then, ```cd``` into the QuickSortPractice/ sub-directory (within the QuickSortPractice folder) and run the command ```dotnet run```. You will be prompted to enter a list of numbers to be sorted (delimited by commas). Enter the list and press enter to use the algorithm.
